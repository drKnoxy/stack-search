Hacker rank had an interesting test that I thought I'd post on Github. Create a stack overflow search / response mock website. Using their api:

* create an ajax based single page app
* interact with the stack overflow api
* search for questions
* provide answers on click
* show inight into accepted answers

## Getting Started
* just fire up a local server in the root directory

## Tech / Frameworks
* git; follow along to see how I work
* bootstrap; super easy
* jQuery - Revealing Module Pattern
